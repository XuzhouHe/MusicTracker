A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
Implement two tab bars for Current Trending Musician and Editor's Favorite Musician, Also did a clear entry on the tracklist as sometimes, a user might want to wipe out the whole playlist that they once created.
* Why did you choose this feature?
Like all music apps (spotify and pandora) we need something to attract its user base, where here with our trending tab and editor favorite's tab it can increase the user likeability to the app as it bring something picky and editor's vibe within the app which make it more human feel.
* How did you implement it?
We implement the tabs by adding two more fragment on the home page, where each page is able to show a editor's pick artish and a trending artists along with a picture gallery of the artist. Implement the picture gallery through adding imageview to the fragment page.
